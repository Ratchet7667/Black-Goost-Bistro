  <h1> About Jen's Kitchen</h1
   <p> The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. 
   <i>Bon Appetit!</i>

  <p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.
